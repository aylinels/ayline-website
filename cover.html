	<p>I had to design three cover designs for a Shakespeare book series. I designed those covers for a mature audience and placed the text at the center of attention by playing with the most famous soliloquy for each. Graphically, the lines illustrate the main protagonist's mindset during the play. The handwritten text also represent the notetaking someone would take as an actor for example as they read the play. The addition of color follows this metaphor of notetaking, by recreating a highlighter. </p>
