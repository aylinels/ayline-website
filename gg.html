	<h1>Web Design: Guerrilla Girls<br><h1 id="date">/2019<h1></h1>
	<div class="text">
	<p>This website is dedicated to the anonymous feminist group called the Guerrilla Girls, devoted to fighting sexism and racism within the art world. I first heard of them when I was in Highschool and have always admired their work. However, I find that often their graphic design lacks some legibility or taste, especially when it comes to their website. When my Creative Computing course had given us the assignment to design a website, I did not hesitate to take this opportunity to redesign their website.
